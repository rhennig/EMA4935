    "\n",
    "Definition: PCA is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated numerical variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Principal component analysis is a fast and flexible unsupervised method for dimensionality reduction in data. It is a linear transformation technique that is widely used across different fields, most prominently for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- PCA is an **unsupervised linear dimensionality reduction technique** that can be utilized for extracting information from a high-dimensional space by projecting it into a lower-dimensional sub-space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It tries to preserve the essential parts that have more variation of the data and remove the non-essential parts with fewer variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dimensions are nothing but features that represent the data. For example, the atomic descriptors we used already included the atomic number, atomic and ionic radii, electronegetivity, etc. Each of these descriptor components is a dimension. Note: Features, Dimensions, and Variables are all referring to the same idea. You will find them being used interchangeably.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can use PCA to cluster similar data points based on the feature correlation between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Five steps of PCA\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal component analysis can be broken down into five steps. We will go through each step, explaining what PCA does and discuss the underlying mathematical concepts such as standardization, covariance, eigenvectors and eigenvalues without focusing on how to compute them.\n",

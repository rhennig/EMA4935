    "# Kernel regressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Kernel regression is a technique for non-parametric estimation of regression models, this means that the method does not make assumptions about the distribution of the data. Unlike linear regression, which estimates a single constant coefficient for each predictor variable, kernel regression estimates a smooth function of the predictor variables. It does it through the kernel, which is a function that determines how similar two points are and estimates new values based on the values from nearby points. This makes it well suited for data sets where the underlying relationship between the dependent and independent variables is non-linear. This method can be applied to curve fitting, prediction, classification, and density estimation. It is also well-suited for data with discontinuities or nonlinear structure. In general, any situation where you need to estimate an unknown function from data can benefit from using kernel regression. There exist several methods, some of them are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Watson estimator** is used for data with high-dimensional features or with highly correlated variables. The kernel $K_h$ for a bandwidth $h$ is used in the expression\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{m}_h(x) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n K_h (x - x_i)\\, y_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^n K_h (x - x_i)}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Priestley-Chao** kernel, on the other hand, is known for being translation invariant. This means that the estimates produced by the regression will be unchanged if the data points are shifted by any constant amount. This is especially important in applications where data may be subject to measurement error or other sources of imprecision, as it ensures that these errors will not affect the results of the analysis. It is calculated with\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{m}_\\mathrm{PC}(x) = h^{-1} \\sum_{1=2}^n (x_i - x_{i-1}) K \\left( \\frac{x - x_i}{h} \\right)\\, y_i,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $h$ is the bandwidth or smoothing parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the **Gasser-Müller** kernel is considered to be more efficient than other types of kernel functions. It has been shown to be more accurate when predicting outcomes for data sets with a high degree of variance. Additionally, the Gasser kernel can handle non-linear relationships between input data points better than other kernel functions. This makes it a popular choice for use in machine learning applications.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{m}_\\mathrm{GM}(x) = h^{-1} \\sum_{1=1}^n \\left[ \\int_{s_{i-1}}^{s_i} K \\left( \\frac{x - u}{h} \\right)\\, du \\right]\\, y_i,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $s_i = (x_{i-1} + x_i)/2$.\n",

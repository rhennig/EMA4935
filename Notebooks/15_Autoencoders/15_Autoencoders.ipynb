    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will learn how to implement an autoencoder. Autoencoders are a type of neural network designed to **learn efficient representations** of input data, typically for the purpose of **dimensionality reduction**, **feature learning**, or **denoising**. They consist of two main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encoder:** Maps the input data to a lower-dimensional latent representation.\n",
    "- **Decoder:** Reconstructs the original data from the latent representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training objective is to minimize the difference between the input and its reconstruction (often using mean squared error)."

    "### üéØ Why Use Autoencoders?\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoencoders are useful in many scenarios, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dimensionality Reduction**  \n",
    "  Similar to PCA but capable of learning **nonlinear** transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Learning**  \n",
    "  The latent space can capture abstract and task-relevant features that are useful for downstream models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Denoising**  \n",
    "  Denoising autoencoders can learn to reconstruct clean inputs from noisy versions, which is useful in preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Anomaly Detection**  \n",
    "  Autoencoders trained on normal data will struggle to reconstruct anomalies, leading to high reconstruction error ‚Äî a useful signal for outlier detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pretraining / Initialization**  \n",
    "  Autoencoders can initialize deep networks (unsupervised pretraining), though this is now less common with modern optimizers and architectures."

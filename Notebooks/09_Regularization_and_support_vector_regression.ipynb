    "In machine learning we use data to approximate a model that is flexible enough to fit such data. Larger flexibility results in a model closer on average to the trainin set, with low bias but large variance. In those situations we need to control and prevent overfitting to the data set. We do this through a concept known as regularization. We will analize common regularization methods and their appication in vector support regression."

    "\n",
    "Regularization is used to constrain (or regularize) the estimated coefficients of a model. This protects the model from overfitting on the training data. In the previous notebook on cross-validation we showed that overfitting of a polynomial regression can lead to poor prediction accuracy. Cross-validation is one approach to reduce overfitting. In that example, we used cross-validation to determine the optimal order of the polynomial for fitting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization lets us include more features into a model while avoiding to overfit through constraints of the optimized model coefficients. In other words, regularization is used to prevent overfitting but too much regularization can result in underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common approach of regularization is to shrink the model coefficients towards zero. We apply such a regularization constraint, we by simply adding a term to our loss function that measures the deviation of the model coefficients from zero.\n",

    "## What are CNNs?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** are a class of deep neural networks specifically designed for **image and spatial data**. Unlike fully connected networks, CNNs are capable of capturing spatial hierarchies in images using local receptive fields and shared weights. Instead of treating each pixel independently, CNNs leverage spatial structure and local context — essential for recognizing patterns in images like edges, textures, and shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are particularly effective in image-related tasks such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Object detection and recognition\n",
    "- Image classification\n",
    "- Semantic segmentation\n",
    "- Super-resolution and denoising\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll build a CNN to **identify nanoparticles in TEM images**.\n",

    "\n",
    "Recall from our previous lecture:\n",
    "- Fully connected (dense) networks treat each input value independently.\n",
    "- A fully connected layer requires a weight for every pixel-to-neuron connection.\n",
    "- For a 256×256 grayscale image, that's **65,536 input** features!\n",
    "— This would lead to millions of parameters in even shallow networks.\n",
    "- For high-resolution TEM images, this quickly becomes computationally infeasible and ignores spatial patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs solve this by:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using convolutional filters (kernels) that slide over the image.\n",
    "Extracting local patterns such as edges, corners, or textures.\n",
    "Sharing weights across spatial locations, which drastically reduces the number of parameters.\n",
    "\n",

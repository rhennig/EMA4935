    "In this notebook we will learn how to implement convolution operations in neural networks. Their architecture tipically consists of a series of filtering layers followed by a multi-layer perceptron. The size for these filters determines the *receptive field* of the convolution operation used to detect different features in the data. Put simple, the receptive field is the portion of the input data used to compute the activation of a neuron in a *feature map*, that corresponds to the ouput of the convolutional layer. There are three hyperparameters that control the size for the output of a convolutional layer. These are related as follows\n",

    "where $O$, is the output size (height/length), $I$ is the input size (height/length), $F$ is the filter size, $P$ is the padding, and $S$ is the stride. For example, our $10 \\times 10$ input  and a $3 \\times 3$ filter with stride of 1 and padding 0 results in a $8 \\times 8$ output. With a stride of 2 and padding 1 we get an output of $5 \\times 5$ instead."

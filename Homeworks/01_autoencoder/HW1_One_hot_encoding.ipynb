    "### What is One-Hot Encoding?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "One-hot encoding is a method for converting categorical data (data that can take on a limited number of distinct values) into a numerical format that machine learning models can understand. Each unique category is represented as a binary vector with a length equal to the number of categories. In this vector, one position corresponding to the category is marked as `1`, and all other positions are marked as `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "For the categories `['H', 'C', 'O', 'N']`:\n",
    "- `H` → `[1, 0, 0, 0]`\n",
    "- `C` → `[0, 1, 0, 0]`\n",
    "- `O` → `[0, 0, 1, 0]`\n",
    "- `N` → `[0, 0, 0, 1]`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose in Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Handling Categorical Data:**\n",
    "   Machine learning algorithms typically work with numerical data. One-hot encoding converts non-numeric categorical features into a numerical format without introducing any ordinality (unlike label encoding, which can mistakenly imply a ranking among categories).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Preventing Misinterpretation:**\n",
    "   For example, in the periodic table, `H` (Hydrogen) and `O` (Oxygen) are not numerically related. Using one-hot encoding ensures that no unintended relationships or biases are introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Enabling Compatibility:**\n",
    "   Many machine learning models (e.g., neural networks, decision trees) require consistent input shapes and cannot process raw categorical data directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Avoiding Bias:**\n",
    "   One-hot encoding ensures all categories are treated equally, preventing the model from assuming that some categories are \"greater than\" others.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use One-Hot Encoding for Molecules?\n",
    "\n",
    "In cheminformatics and materials science, molecules often consist of categorical data like atom types. Using one-hot encoding:\n",
    "- Ensures that all atom types (e.g., H, C, O, N) are treated as distinct entities.\n",
    "- Prepares molecular data for machine learning models that predict properties such as reactivity, toxicity, or material behavior.\n",
    "- Captures the molecular composition in a structured and interpretable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying one-hot encoding to molecules, we can convert molecular structures into a numerical representation suitable for machine learning workflows, ensuring compatibility and preventing bias in the data."
